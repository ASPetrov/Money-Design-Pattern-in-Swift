# Money Design Pattern in Swift

Simple implementation of The Money Pattern, defined by Martin Fowler.

## Installation

Money Framework is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

To install add the following line to your Podfile:

``` Ruby
pod 'MoneyFramework'
```

## Build Settings

Base SDK:  Latest
Deployment Target:  10.0

> **NB! You can build an application with latest Base SDK that runs under iOS 10. But then you have to take care to not use any function or method that is not available on iOS 10. If you do, your application will crash on iOS 10 as soon as this function is used.**
